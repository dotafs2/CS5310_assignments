# fsEngine
fsEngine a custom game engine built from scratch, primarily using C for low-level logic, based on principles learned from Bruce A. Maxwell's computer graphics course. The interface is developed using Qt, leveraging modern features of C++17 and C++20.

## Project Goal

My goal is to build a complete engine, even if most of the libraries are hand-written and less efficient than existing ones. The objective is to create a modular engine with fixed APIs and formats at each level, allowing for customization and changes to any step in the pipeline for different targets. This approach will enable a fully customizable engine pipeline, where each stage can be adapted to specific needs.
